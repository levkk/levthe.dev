            <description>Well, this is awkward, I have never written a personal blog before. I guess hi, thanks for making it over here, and nice to meet you.
I am an software engineer, I live in San Francisco and I have an adorable 5 month old puppy I take care of full time. I also have a day job, which often stretches into the evening hours.

<p>You read this far, so here is a picture of her passed out in front of my house:</p>

<p>She was too tired to make it up 35 steps, so I let her take a quick nap.</p>
<p>Things I might write about in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>My dog</li>
<li>My job</li>
<li>Random engineering projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheers.</p>
