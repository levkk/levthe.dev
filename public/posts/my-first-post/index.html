<p>You read this far, so here is a picture of her passed out in front of my house:</p>
<p><img src="puppy-sleeping.jpeg" alt="puppy"></p>
<p>She was too tired to make it up 35 steps, so I let her take a quick nap.</p>
<p>Things I might write about in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>My dog</li>
<li>My job</li>
<li>Random engineering projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheers.</p>
